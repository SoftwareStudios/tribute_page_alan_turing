# A tribute page to Alan Turing developed in HTML and CSS 

## Project Description


I developed this project with the help of a tutorial in responsive web design to brush up on my HTML and CSS skills. It's been a while since I coded anything related to the web, and honestly, I am a little rusty. Alan Turing's work contributed to the basis of modern computer science and artificial intelligence. As a project, I felt this would be a giving way to pay tribute to one of humanity's great minds while demonstrating my basic web design skills. 

## Difficulties Faced

Although this project is a single webpage and it's simplistic in design, I realize my front-end skills are not strong. I am comfortable writing HTML, but I need time to further my understanding of CSS design principles.
