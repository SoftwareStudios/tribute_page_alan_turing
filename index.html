        <h2 id="headline">Here is a short time line of Alan Turing's life and achievements:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale, London.</li>
          <li><strong>1918</strong> - Turing joins St Michael&#39;s day school in Hastings, UK.</li>
          <li><strong>1922</strong> - Turing is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School, UK and learns to play chess.</li>
          <li><strong>1926</strong> - Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in Dorset. </li>
          <li><strong>1931</strong> - Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
          <li><strong>1935</strong> - Turing proves the central limit theorem in his dissertation and is made a fellow at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
          <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem).</li>
          <li><strong>1936-1938</strong> - Turing went to the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, studying under Alonzo Church. There he started to study cryptology and mathematics.</li>
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - Turing started to work part-time at the Government Code and Cypher School, Cheltenham, UK.</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> - Turing works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. </li>
          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Turing and his colleagues break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. Turing travelled to the United States in November and worked with U.S. Navy cryptanalysts on Naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington.</li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - Turing is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology (code-breaking). Works at Bell Laboratories on speech encypherment.</li>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - At the end of World War Two, Turing is awarded an <abbr title="Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr> for his services to his country. Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory where he worked on developing an electronic digital stored-program computing machine that would later become the <abbr title="Automatic Computing Engine">ACE</abbr> .</li>
          <li><strong>1946</strong> - Published the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. Turing and his group pioneer modern computer programming, writing a library of sophisticated programs for the unbuilt <abbr title="Automatic Computing Engine">ACE</abbr>.
          <li><strong>1947</strong> - Turing returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. The <abbr>ACE</abbr> was built in his absence and executed its first program on 10 May 1950.</li>
          <li><strong>1949</strong> - Turing became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers: the Manchester Mark 1. He also explored the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that attempted to define a standard for machine intelligence, which would later become known as the Turing test.</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. Turing&#39;s homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him.</li>
          <li><strong>1953</strong> - Turing publishes his classic paper on computer chess.</li> 
          <li><strong>1954</strong> - Dies of cyanide poisoning June 7 in Wilmslow, Cheshire, England. June 8th, Turing&#39;s body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by cyanide poisoning. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium.</li>
