            country. Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory where he worked on developing an electronic digital

          <p>Turing became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software for
            one of the earliest stored program computers: the Manchester Mark 1. He also explored the problem of
            artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that attempted to define a standard for machine
            intelligence, which would later become known as the Turing test.</p>

          <p>Turing is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. Turing&#39;s homosexuality
            resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom.
            He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very
            detrimental effect on him.</p>
